      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Xishun Liao is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the UCLA Mobility Lab. He specializes in motion prediction/planning/control for autonomous driving, urban mobility modeling, applied AI/ML, driving/traffic simulation, vehicle-to-everything (V2X), and intelligent transportation system. Through his research, Dr. Liao aims to construct a comprehensive, human-centered AI-based digital twin for urban mobility system. This framework integrates data-driven insights across multiple scales—from individual humans and vehicles to overall traffic—to enhance traffic optimization and support the evolution of autonomous driving technologies. His work emphasizes improving future transportation systems' safety, sustainability, efficiency, accessibility, and equity, reinforcing a people-centric approach.
